# UHC Pantuflas Minecraft Plugin

This is an open-source project that consists of a Minecraft plugin designed to allow players to create and customize
"Ultra Hardcore" (UHC) game mode matches on a Minecraft server. UHC is a challenging game mode where players must
survive in a world where natural health regeneration is disabled, allowing players to regain health artificially by
consuming golden apples or instant health potions, among other options. Furthermore, once a player dies, they are
eliminated from the game with no possibility of respawning.

## Project State

The plugin is currently under development. Its version is 0.0.0-INITIAL so most of the features aren't implemented yet.
You can check the projects current state in clicking in [Project State](PROJECT_STATE.md), where you can also see future tasks.

## Key Features

- **Total Customization**: Our UHC Pantuflas plugin offers extensive customization options, allowing users to tailor
matches to their preferences. You can enjoy the following features:
  - Automatic Datapack Loader: Easily add any datapack with a simple setup.
  - Death Rewards Manager: Customize the incentives given to players for achieving a kill.
  - Time Manager: Personalize the duration of each phase of the game.
  - Custom Regeneration: Decide how many hearts each healing item regenerates.

- **Various Game Modes:** Users can choose from several UHC game modes, including solo matches, team games from the
start, or team creation phases during the match. It is also possible to add additional challenges during the game, such
as day-night cycles stopping or random events to keep the gameplay exciting.

- **Final Battle:** At the end of the match, all surviving players must head to the center of the world for an exciting
final battle. The last player standing will be the winner of the match.
