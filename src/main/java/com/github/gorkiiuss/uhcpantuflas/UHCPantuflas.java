/**
 * UHCPantuflas is a Minecraft plugin that allows players to create and customize
 * "Ultra Hardcore" (UHC) game mode matches on a Minecraft server.
 * <p>
 * UHC is a challenging game mode where players must survive in a world where
 * natural health regeneration is disabled. Players have various methods to regain
 * health artificially, including consuming golden apples or instant health potions.
 * Furthermore, once a player dies, they are eliminated from the game with no
 * possibility of respawning.
 * <p>
 * This plugin is designed to handle the core functionality of the UHC game mode
 * within the Minecraft server environment. It extends the JavaPlugin class,
 * allowing it to integrate seamlessly with the Bukkit/Spigot API.
 *
 * @version 0.0.0-INITIAL
 * @since 01/10/2023-INITIAL
